# Coup

This project is to create an open source Coup game server that is API accessable. Coup is a bluffing game with a limited move set, so it is easily analyzable by a search algorithm. Long term, I hope to create a machine player.

There are three files, coupserver.py runs the server. coupclient.py will be a python graphical client. coupai.py will be a client that plays on its own.
